Scripts for processing raw Q2 fluorophore data
This is a script for converting raw Q2 fluorophore data into respiratory rates of leaves. The script must be run for each Q2 plate wanting to be analysed.
A metadata sheet must be completed for each plate to process. An example raw data file Data_Example.xls and corresponding metadata Metadata_Example.xlsx of a metadata sheet is given.
